1. **Title:** Located at the top of the login form. **_Login_**, spelled as one word, is a noun or an adjective. For example, the information you use to sign in to your email is your login (noun), and the page where you sign in is the login page (adjective). **Log in** is two words when it functions as a verb. For example, you **log in** with your login information.
