# Actionable Language

For calls to action (CTAs), try to be as specific as possible. It helps the user know what action to expect when interacting with the UI. Use this guide to find the most appropriate verb for an experience.

## Make a selection

### Select

Use `Select` when the user must decide on multiple options.

## Move back and forth

### Back

Use `Back` to take the user to the previous step in a multi-step process. Pair this with `Next`. If the user will lose changes, warn them ahead of time that they will lose any changes that have been made.

### Previous

Use `Previous` instead of `Back` for pagination in tables.

### Next

Use `Next` to take the user to the next step in a multi-step process. Pair this with `Back`.

Don’t use: Proceed, Continue

## Postpone action

### Skip

Use `Skip` to allow the user to postpone an action or decision. It’s a way for the user to avoid interruption and proceed with their current task.

## Receive confirmation

### Done

Use `Done` to confirm the completion of a multi-step process.

Don’t use: OK, Got it, or Close

### OK

CTAs make it clear what will happen when a user interacts with it. OK doesn’t do a great job of that. If you must use OK - write it as `OK` not Okay or Ok.

## Make changes

### Create

Use `Create` when the user is about to make a brand new thing in the product.

Example: Create new template, Create new user

### Add

Use `Add` when moving something in the product from one place to another.

Example: Add Treatment Plan, Add machine, Add user, Add permissions
