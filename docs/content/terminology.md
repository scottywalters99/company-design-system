|    `MeV`     | Mega Electron Volts | This is a measurement used for electron treatments in Radiation Therapy.                                                                                                                                                                   | The doctor wrote the prescription for 5 fractions at 300cGy for 10 days using 9MeV. This would be an example of the prescription that the Radiation Oncologist would write in a patient chart for the treatment of a superficial cancer.<br><br>Note: This can also commonly be communicated as 6e, 9e, 12e etc. instead of 6MeV, 9MeV etc. |
|     `MV`     | Megavolt            | This is a measurement used for photon treatments in Radiation Therapy.                                                                                                                                                                     | The doctor wrote a prescription for 28 fractions at 180cGy for 28 days using 6MV.

| :----------: | :------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `2D CRT`   | 2D conventional Radiation Therapy     | The treatment field is drawn on a 2D x-ray image or a fluoroscopy x-ray machine is used to outline the area of treatment. This is not commonly used today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|   `3D CRT`   | 3D conformal Radiation Therapy        | A CT scan or cat scan is used to plan the radiation treatment. Using the CT scan gives the user a more in-depth look at the tumor that needs to be treated and the surrounding normal tissues that should be avoided or get limited dose. One or more static beams are placed to achieve this.                                                                                                                              |
|    `IMRT`    | Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy | It uses radiation beams of different intensities. The beams deliver appropriate doses of radiation to the tumor and reduce the dose to nearby healthy tissue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|    `SRS`     | Stereotactic Radiosurgery             | Uses many precisely focused radiation beams to treat small tumors in the brain. This can be done using a head frame or no head frame. The head frame is a very precise immobilization device. SRS is done in one fraction but a high dose. This can be done with cones or multiple MLC shapes depending on the machine that will be doing the delivery. Specialized linear accelerators and Gammaknife machines can do SRS. |
|    `SRT`     | Stereotactic radiotherapy             | This is treatment that delivers high dose in 2-5 fractions. This treatment type can be used in many areas of the body. This approach may be used for tumors too large for radiosurgery or those in an area that is not as easy to immobilize. This can also be done with cones or MLC shapes. Specialized linear accelerators and Cyberknife machines can do SRT or SBRT.                                                   |
|    `VMAT`    | Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy      | Similar to IMRT in that this type of treatment is delivered with control points or beamlets that are created by different MLC shapes. The difference is that the delivery machine is moving around the patient while the radiation is on. This is the most common type of treatment done today.                                                                                                                             |

|    `cGy`     | Centigray            | A unit of absorbed radiation dose equal to one hundredth (10âˆ’2) of a gray (Gy) 1, or 1 rad.                            |

|    Brachy    | Brachytherapy | The use of Radioactive materials that are placed inside the body for a calculated time. The brachytherapy source can be in the form of seeds, ribbons or single sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | HDR (high dose rate) and LDR (Low dose rate) are two types of brachytherapy. HDR uses a machine to move the radioactive source to the correct position in the body for the correct time. LDR is a manual procedure where an apparatus is placed in the body then the radioactive source(s) is placed for a specified time. |
|              | Electrons     | A stream of electrons (small negatively charged particles found in atoms) that can be used for radiation therapy. Electrons are used to treat skin cancers and other tumors that are close to the skin. Electrons also come from the linear accelerator.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Used for specific treatments such as skin cancers and boosting dose to a scar where the tumor had been removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|              | Photons       | A type of radiation therapy that uses x-rays or gamma rays that come from a special machine called a linear accelerator (linac). The radiation dose is delivered at the surface of the body and goes into the tumor and through the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Photons are the most common modality in Radiation Therapy. Most anatomical sites can be treated with photons. Most Radiation Therapy centers have at least one machine that uses photons for treatment.                                                                                                                    |
|              | Protons       | A type of radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can reduce the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. It is used to treat cancers of the head and neck and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, spine, and prostate. Protons can stop at the edge of the tumor to reduce dose to other tissues. This is often used in pediatric treatments. | Specialized treatment. These machines used for Proton treatments are very expensive compared to the linear accelerator. Although growing, there are not many proton machines in use.                                                                                                                                       |
