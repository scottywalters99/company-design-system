# Typography

Use typography deliberately to create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through information and workflows.

## Backstory

**Typeface - Helvetica Neue**

The Helvetica® (Latin for Swiss) has the objective and functional style which was associated with Swiss typography in the 1950s and 1960s. The font is perfect for international correspondence: no ornament, no emotion, just clear presentation of information.

## Type Scale

This Type Scale was created to conform to the 4px grid layout principal in the design guidelines. It is a robust scale that offers solutions for simple to complex hierarchies in layouts and components. The scale is calculated from a 14px (1rem) base.

## Type Styles

Type styles are used to help manage the visual hiearchy of a document.

### Weight

Font weight is used to differentiate content hierarchy. A **bold** font-weight will always rank higher than a lighter weight font of the same size. Type with a lighter font weight can on rank higher if the font size is significantly larger that the bold type.

**Italic**

The _italic style_ should only be used to emphasize certain words in sentences like captions, clinical terms, technical terms, and devices.

## Type Color

To achieve balance and harmony in our interface designs - across all digital products at COMPANY , deliberate use of color is paramount. Follow the guidelines to ensure the best usability outcomes and to meet the accessibility standards for sight-impaired users. To achieve text accessibility to all users designers focus on contrast. This is scored by evaluating the size and color of the text against the background color. For more on how the contrast score is calculated see the [WCAG AA Standards](//www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) success criterion.
